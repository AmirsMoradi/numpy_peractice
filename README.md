In order to design a simple data mining exercise using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries that do not use for loops and instead use vectorized functions, we can focus on statistical data analysis.

Suggested exercise: Analyzing random data using the normal distribution

Purpose of the exercise:

• Creating random data from normal distribution.

• Calculate and display the average, standard deviation and other statistical features of the data.

• Draw histograms and other graphs to visualize data.

I hope this exercise will help you and I will give you the final photo.
